## Step 1: Install Necessary Libraries
- Install the required libraries, including LangChain, OpenAI, and TikToken, to enable efficient text processing.

## Step 2: Import Essential Modules
- Import essential modules such as TextLoader for loading text files, RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter for chunking strategies, and OpenAI embeddings for embedding operations.

## Step 3: Text Chunking
- Utilize the RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter to segment text into manageable chunks.
- Configure the chunk size to 1024 characters with an overlap of 48 characters for optimal processing.
- Conduct a test embedding to ensure the embedding system functions correctly, validating the effectiveness of the text chunking process.

## Step 4: Setting Up PostgreSQL with Vector Extension
- Install `psycopg2-binary` and `pgvector` packages to facilitate database operations.
- Define the PostgreSQL connection string, specifying the IP address and database name.
- Initialize PostgreSQL container with the vector extension enabled to enhance database functionality.
